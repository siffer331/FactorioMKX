[item-description]
power-armor-mk3=The ultimate Power armor with infinite cababilities
assembling-machine-4=The next gen assembling machine with almost no power consumption. It has 8 module slots, and a higher crafting speed.
fish-mk2=An elite in the aqueous food chain, this mahatma is nothing to underestimate. Forged from ionizing rays, this breed is the peak of evolution with dangerously high jaw strength to body weight ratio and logic to compete with a 128-qubit quantum computer.
atomic-bomb-mk2=The atomic bomb MK2 uses the unmatched logic from an overclocked fish MK2 (It likes the voltage anyways) to increase the distance. We all know, that more distance = more space for a huge explosion! (The blast of this bomb is subject to change in patches after MKX 1.0.0, as animation and destructiveness is hard to syncronize(We are going a lot bigger (=you didn't waste your resources)))

automation-4=The next gen assembling machine with almost no power consumption. It has 8 module slots, and a higher crafting speed.
fusion-reactor-equipment-mk2=A more efficient fusion reactor to supply your armor.
power-armor-mk3=Powerful armor with an immense equipment grid. Low density structures allow for bigger pockets.
modules4=Module 4 comes with even better perks. Productivity module 4 works in beacons.
aquarium=The A.Q.R.M provides a balanced, but harsh environment for fish to ionize.
fish-mk2=The fish MK2 is a trooper at you disposal, calculating rocket trajectory to the nanometer on the fly.
atomic-bomb-mk2=The atomic bomb MK2 has a longer range (thank the kamikaze fish for that!) than the the mk1 version as well as more OOMFF (The blast of this bomb is subject to change in patches after MKX 1.0.0, as animation and destructiveness is hard to syncronize(We are going a lot bigger (=you didn't waste your resources)))

assembling-machine-4=The next gen assembling machine with almost no power consumption. It has 8 module slots, and a higher crafting speed.
aquarium=The Aquatic, Questionably Radioactive Marine-pit (A.Q.R.M) dramatically increases the speed off the ionization process, as this is pretty difficult to perform in hand, as space is limited.
