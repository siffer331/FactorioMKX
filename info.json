  "description": "This mod adds an extra mk for the things you love in Factorio. Power Armor mk 3? You got it! Speed-, Efficiency-, and Productivity module 4? Most definitely!

Thank you so much :) This time it took a little longer to release, as we are pretty busy. Remember to give feedback in the Discussion page on https://mods.factorio.com/mod/MKX as we would be happy to get some ideas/concepts presented. Currently, the Atomic Bomb MK2 doesn't satisfy us. Hopefully that will change for 1.1.0 or something. :D Stay AWESOME\n\n-Siffer & Tyflon"
